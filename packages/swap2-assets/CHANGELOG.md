# @anywalletkit/swap2-assets

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d0e46e: Swaps of tokens the catalog does not list (a user's own tokens, named by EVM contract or Solana mint), opt-in with `allowUnlistedTokens: true` on the engine and on `createSwap2Handler`; off by default, nothing changes without it. The engine reads the source token's decimals with the account's `getTokenInfo` (cached; a disagreeing `fromTokenDecimals` is refused) and sends them as `QuoteParams.sourceDecimals`; approvals go to the named token for the exact amount and the quoted spender, with the same value binding as catalog tokens. LI.FI, Uniswap, Balancer and Fynd resolve the source with the new `sourceAssetOf(params)`; providers with their own asset lists keep refusing. `swap2-assets` adds `isTokenAddress`, `unlistedAsset`, `isUnlisted`, `resolveAsset` (catalog first, always) and `catalogChainId`.

### Patch Changes

- 6dde4e4: Catalog: LDO, SKY and COW on Ethereum, LDO and COW on Arbitrum, COW on Base. Each contract was checked on chain (symbol, decimals, name) and routed both ways through the swap2 providers (LI.FI on every chain, plus Uniswap and Balancer on Ethereum) before it was listed. SKY on Arbitrum and LDO on Optimism were left out: no route, or too thin.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 07db4c1: Audit 2026-10-25, findings 16 and 17.
  
  - **Number() on bigints.** A real ESLint now runs on every package (`pnpm lint`, in CI): typescript-eslint's `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises`, and a local `no-number-bigint` rule (`Number(x)` of a bigint is lossy above 2^53 and garbage on Hermes above 2^63). Its 92 findings are fixed: values that come from outside are range-checked as bigints before they become numbers (a typed-data or transaction `chainId`, token `decimals` in tx-preview, ABI string lengths, protobuf field numbers in Tron, an RPC nonce in extension-kit, the Permit2 lockdown count in kit's policies, Mellow's asset count); sort comparators compare bigints exactly; panic codes print the bigint; display values go through `bigintToNumber`. A `chainId` that is not a safe integer is now refused by wallet-evm before signing (`UnsafeTransactionError`), and `describeTransaction` reports it as a chain mismatch.
  - **engines.** Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
  - **Peers.** `expo-modules-core` in `backup-cloud` and `secure-storage-react-native` is `^58.0.0` (Expo SDK 58, the version the native modules are tested on) instead of `*`.
- a9a5e0a: package.json carried a second, empty `description` that overrode the real one, so npm showed the README badge line instead of the package description.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 2975c93: README: an npm badge and an Install section (npm / pnpm / yarn, the peers to add, a link to the package on npm and to the release workflow that publishes it with provenance).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 65c3bca: First release through npm trusted publishing: published from the release workflow over GitHub OIDC, with no npm token anywhere. No code change in this package beyond what its other changesets list.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e4083a3: npm metadata for the first public release: repository (with the package directory), homepage, bugs and publishConfig { access: public, provenance: true }; LICENSE inside every package; READMEs for core, conformance, protocol-swap2-core, swap2-assets and tx-preview-evm; descriptions for protocol-swap2-core and swap2-assets.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7004ecf: New package: USDT0 — Tether's LayerZero OFT for USDT — as a swap2 provider. USDT / USDT0 between 13 EVM chains (Ethereum adapter, Arbitrum, OP, Polygon, HyperEVM, Ink, Berachain, Unichain, Sei, Plasma, Monad, MegaETH, X Layer) in one source transaction: `quoteOFT` + `quoteSend` on the OFT itself, `send` with the LayerZero fee as `msg.value` (declared as `nativeFee`), approval only for the Ethereum adapter, every deployment bound on-chain (`token()`, `approvalRequired()`, `peers`), preflight against the live fee, status from LayerZero Scan (DELIVERED carries the destination hash), and the `lzReceive` retry of a stored payload as the engine's claim. The asset catalog gains USDT0 on HyperEVM and Unichain.
- e0edbf6: Zcash is no longer hidden in the swap catalog (the wallet signs ZEC itself now). 1Click dry quotes from Zcash use a real t-address placeholder with an origin-chain refund, like every other source — the INTENTS-side refund special case is gone.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`anywalletkit` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).
