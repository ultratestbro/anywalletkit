## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 80d6451: `verifyTypedData` accepts the signatures `signTypedData` makes when the domain `chainId` is a string. Signing normalised `"0x89"` / `"137"` to the number 137 before hashing (so `chainId` is part of the domain, as a verifying contract computes it), while verifying hashed the domain as given — the account's own signature did not verify. Both now use one `typedDataHash()`. Audit 2026-10-25, #1.6.
- 07db4c1: Audit 2026-10-25, findings 16 and 17.
  
  - **Number() on bigints.** A real ESLint now runs on every package (`pnpm lint`, in CI): typescript-eslint's `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises`, and a local `no-number-bigint` rule (`Number(x)` of a bigint is lossy above 2^53 and garbage on Hermes above 2^63). Its 92 findings are fixed: values that come from outside are range-checked as bigints before they become numbers (a typed-data or transaction `chainId`, token `decimals` in tx-preview, ABI string lengths, protobuf field numbers in Tron, an RPC nonce in extension-kit, the Permit2 lockdown count in kit's policies, Mellow's asset count); sort comparators compare bigints exactly; panic codes print the bigint; display values go through `bigintToNumber`. A `chainId` that is not a safe integer is now refused by wallet-evm before signing (`UnsafeTransactionError`), and `describeTransaction` reports it as a chain mismatch.
  - **engines.** Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
  - **Peers.** `expo-modules-core` in `backup-cloud` and `secure-storage-react-native` is `^58.0.0` (Expo SDK 58, the version the native modules are tested on) instead of `*`.
- 80d6451: No signing account outlives `WalletManager.dispose()`. Every chain manager awaited between its cache check and storing the account, so: an account whose build was in flight during `dispose()` was created afterwards with a live key (a child derived from an injected seed signer kept signing); concurrent `getAccount` calls for one path built two accounts and leaked the first; a signer-built manager handed out new accounts after `dispose()`. New protected `cachedAccount()` / `signerAccount()` in core build each account once, refuse after dispose, dispose an account finished late and a derived child that never became an account. All seven chain managers use them. `describeChainModule` checks the contract (one account under concurrent calls, none after dispose). Audit 2026-10-25, #3.
- 80d6451: `policies.maxFee` now holds for the transaction that is signed, not only for the quote. The kit compared the cap with `quoteSendTransaction` (an EVM estimate of 21 000 gas) while the account signed its own gas limit with headroom (25 200 gas), so a 22 000 000 wei cap let a 25 200 000 wei transaction through. New `WriteOptions { maxFee }` in core is an optional second argument of `sendTransaction`, `signTransaction` and `transfer`; every chain package checks the tighter of it and its configured `transactionMaxFee` / `transferMaxFee` on what it signs (`feeLimit()` helper), and the kit passes the tightest matching policy cap through it after the quote check. A write whose quote fits but whose signed worst case does not is now refused by the account after `confirm`, with the chain package's own error (EVM: `Error('Exceeded maximum fee cost…')`), not `PolicyViolationError`. Audit 2026-10-25, #4.
- 760ca6e: Security fixes from the 2026-10-25 audit.
  
  - **No second signature on failover.** A lost broadcast answer followed by `already known` from the next RPC now resolves to the hash of the transaction already sent, instead of signing a new one with the next nonce (a double payment). `nonce too low` is re-signed only after the account has checked that the rejected hash is not on the network; when that lookup fails the send ends as `BroadcastUnknownError`. `replacement transaction underpriced` is no longer retried.
  - **The fee cap holds for what is signed.** `transferMaxFee` / `transactionMaxFee` were checked on a network quote while the caller's own `gasPrice` / `maxFeePerGas` was signed. They are now checked on the prepared transaction (gas limit × fee cap) before every signature, in `signTransaction` too, and the balance check uses the same worst-case fee. `quoteSendTransaction` prices the caller's fee fields, so the kit `maxFee` policy sees them. `TransferResult.fee` is that worst-case fee. A caller tip above the network's now lifts the fee cap with it (it used to produce a tip above the cap).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 5d7976e: Security audit 2026-10-13 fixes that had stayed on a side branch: Solana provider-tx guard refuses System Assign/Allocate, Token Batch and undecodable core instructions and checks ownership/authority in the post-state (F1, F2); tx-preview flags native value to unlabeled contracts and unverified token symbols (F5); approvals gets a strict `isRevokeCalldata` and a new `isRevokeTransaction` (F8); kit `applyPolicies` resolves or refuses an unknown EVM chain (F4); NEAR caps token storage deposits (F12); TON checks the jetton wallet's owner and master (F13); EVM signing detects the chain before the mismatch check and strips EIP-712 array types linearly (F16, F17); near-intents strips control characters from logs (F18).
- 4b6d97f: No secret is an object property anywhere. `Wallet` no longer keeps the seed phrase string: it turns the phrase into the 64-byte seed in the constructor, hands each chain manager a copy, and `dispose()` zeroizes it and refuses later calls; `new Wallet(seedBytes)` and managers built from seed bytes are accepted (copied). `LocalSigner` keys and seeds and `WalletManager` seeds live in module WeakMaps, so `console.log`, `JSON.stringify`, `util.inspect` and crash reporters see only public fields; `LocalSigner.toJSON()` is the public view. Accounts get leaf signers (`LocalSigner.leafFromSeed`, `deriveLeaf`) that hold only their own key, never a copy of the master seed. Before: `JSON.stringify(account)` contained the private key and the master seed, and `console.log(wallet)` printed the phrase. The conformance chain suite now walks every property reachable from a manager and an account and fails if a key, the seed or the phrase is found. Manager constructors take `string | Uint8Array | Signer`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 82464d8: `WalletManager` keeps the 64-byte seed, never the mnemonic string: a phrase passed to a constructor is stretched there and dropped (strings cannot be zeroized, `Uint8Array`s can). Chain managers read it through `seedBytes()`; the base `dispose()` zeroizes it.
- 29af9d6: EIP-712 domain `chainId` sent as a string (hex "0x89" or decimal) is now hashed as a NUMBER. viem includes `chainId` in the EIP712Domain type only for numeric values, so such typed data was signed over a domain without chainId and the verifying contract rejected the signature (Omniston EVM→TON order on Polygon, 2026-10-16: registered, never filled). `WalletAccountEvm.signTypedData` normalizes (and the cross-chain guard now recognizes hex strings), the swap2 engine normalizes before handing typed orders to any signer, and the Omniston provider returns typed data with a numeric chainId.

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`anywalletkit` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).
