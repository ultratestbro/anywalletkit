# @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-lifi

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 418fea1: A remote provider's addresses come from the app, never from its backend. `remoteProvider` takes `callTargets(chain)` / `spenders(chain)` — the provider package's pins, spread in: `lifiPins`, `fyndPins`, `uniswapPins`, `chainflipPins`, `cctpPins` (with its `claimTargets`), `usdt0Pins`, `balancerPins`, `wrapPins` — and an optional `verifyQuote(params, quote)` that runs the provider's own check on the client (`fyndPins` carries `fyndVerifyQuote`: `checkFyndTransaction` against the app's request). The stub is marked `remote: true`; the engine then lets its EVM routes call only pinned targets and approve only pinned spenders. **Fail closed: a remote stub without pins gets no EVM calldata route or approval** — the router and the single-provider path drop such a quote with the reason (`remotePinRefusal`), deposit-address routes need no pins. Wire the pins in every app that proxies providers through `createSwap2Handler`.
  
  For every provider, a token call in a swap's calldata must move the source token, at most the swap amount, to this account, the deposit address of a deposit-address route, or the declared spender (for a remote stub: the pins); `setApprovalForAll` and Permit2 `approve` are never a swap's main call, and `transferFrom` is refused. Before, `{to: USDC, data: approve(attacker, MAX), approvalAddress: attacker}` from a backend, or `cbBTC.transfer(attacker, all)` with `depositAddress = attacker`, passed because the allowlist was the response's own addresses. The router's provider snapshot now keeps the remote marker and the pins (dropped there, execution through the router took a remote stub for a local provider).
  
  **Breaking:** a `remoteProvider` without `callTargets` / `spenders` gets no calldata route on EVM — spread the provider's pins (`lifiPins`, `fyndPins`, …); swap calldata may only move the source token, by at most the input; an operator or Permit2 approval or a `transferFrom` as the swap call is refused. Upgrade notes: https://docs.anywallet.tech/getting-started/upgrading/.
- f3ec101: The Diamond calldata check reads every swap step, not only the first and last: each step must spend what the one before delivered, only steps spending the input token may pull from the wallet (`requiresDeposit`), together at most the input — a middle step depositing DAI under a leftover allowance was accepted. The GenericSwapFacet V3 entry points are bound to the asset kinds they move: `*ToNative` only for a native output, `*ToERC20` only for a token output, `NativeTo*` / `ERC20To*` only for the matching input — a `*ToNative` call counted a USDC minimum in wei. A bridge without source swaps must bridge the input, less at most a 1 % bridge fee (a `minAmount` of 1 passed and left the rest of the allowance standing). **`apiUrl` must be `https:`**; `allowInsecureApiUrl: true` allows plain http for local development.
  
  **Breaking:** `apiUrl` must be https (`allowInsecureApiUrl`); routes whose steps do not chain, that deposit another token, or that bridge less than the input − 1 % are refused. Upgrade notes: https://docs.anywallet.tech/getting-started/upgrading/.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- b1350b4: Every type a public signature uses is exported, so the API reference documents it and apps can name it: the provider config types (`LifiSwap2Config`, `BalancerSwap2Config`, `NearIntentsSwap2Config`, `FyndSwap2Config`, …), the explorer client options in history-evm (`EtherscanClientOptions`, `AlchemyClientOptions`, `BlockscoutClientOptions`), `Swap2ExecutionPhase`, the Omniston client shapes, and the row / view types the chain packages already expose through their methods. Type-only additions, plus the account-meta role constants of native SOL staking (`READONLY`, `WRITABLE`, …). Renames on export: Aave and Morpho activity `Action` → `AaveActivityAction` / `MorphoActivityAction`; conformance `ProtocolCtor` / `WriteProtocolCtor`; history-evm `RawRow`.
- eb14cb5: npm metadata: every package has a description and the `anywalletkit` keyword. The LI.FI, NEAR Intents, Omniston and THORChain packages had an empty description, so npm showed the README badge markdown in its place, and 24 packages were missing from a `keywords:anywalletkit` search. `pnpm pack:check` now refuses a package without either.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- b55aa5d: LI.FI status `INVALID` is reported `failed` instead of staying `pending` forever.
- 398129f: Node 20 is no longer supported: `engines.node` is now `>=22`. Node 20 reached end of life in April 2026 and gets no security fixes, including the October 2026 release (Brotli decoder, `dns.resolve`, TLS hostname checks; fixed in 22.23.4, 24.22.1 and 26.12.1). CI tests on Node 22 and 24 and refuses to run on an unpatched Node.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 3f3c4fd: Bridge calldata must use one of LI.FI's ABI-encoded bridge entry points (`startBridgeTokensVia*` / `swapAndStartBridgeTokensVia*`, computed from the facet sources): a packed call whose bytes merely look like a `BridgeData` is refused. Routes with source swaps are no longer refused for comparing the bridged amount (the swapped token) with the input. The README states what is not checked: a bridge's output minimum lives in bridge-specific data.
- 6857b7f: LI.FI quotes are checked against their Diamond calldata, not only the `action` / `estimate` beside it: a same-chain swap must pay the reviewed recipient at least the reviewed minimum in the requested tokens, a bridge's `BridgeData` must pay the reviewed recipient on the requested chain, bridging the input token. Routes with a destination call, EVM-source routes to a non-EVM chain (their receiver cannot be read here) and calldata that decodes as nothing known are refused.
- e9cc028: A blank `recipient` / `refundAddress` (`""` from an empty input) is treated as omitted: the swap goes to, and refunds to, the account itself, and the review shows that address. CCTP, USDT0 and LI.FI use their placeholder address only for dry quotes; a live quote without a recipient or refund address is refused instead of being built to the placeholder.
- 0d0e46e: Swaps of tokens the catalog does not list (a user's own tokens, named by EVM contract or Solana mint), opt-in with `allowUnlistedTokens: true` on the engine and on `createSwap2Handler`; off by default, nothing changes without it. The engine reads the source token's decimals with the account's `getTokenInfo` (cached; a disagreeing `fromTokenDecimals` is refused) and sends them as `QuoteParams.sourceDecimals`; approvals go to the named token for the exact amount and the quoted spender, with the same value binding as catalog tokens. LI.FI, Uniswap, Balancer and Fynd resolve the source with the new `sourceAssetOf(params)`; providers with their own asset lists keep refusing. `swap2-assets` adds `isTokenAddress`, `unlistedAsset`, `isUnlisted`, `resolveAsset` (catalog first, always) and `catalogChainId`.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 07db4c1: Audit 2026-10-25, findings 16 and 17.
  
  - **Number() on bigints.** A real ESLint now runs on every package (`pnpm lint`, in CI): typescript-eslint's `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises`, and a local `no-number-bigint` rule (`Number(x)` of a bigint is lossy above 2^53 and garbage on Hermes above 2^63). Its 92 findings are fixed: values that come from outside are range-checked as bigints before they become numbers (a typed-data or transaction `chainId`, token `decimals` in tx-preview, ABI string lengths, protobuf field numbers in Tron, an RPC nonce in extension-kit, the Permit2 lockdown count in kit's policies, Mellow's asset count); sort comparators compare bigints exactly; panic codes print the bigint; display values go through `bigintToNumber`. A `chainId` that is not a safe integer is now refused by wallet-evm before signing (`UnsafeTransactionError`), and `describeTransaction` reports it as a chain mismatch.
  - **engines.** Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
  - **Peers.** `expo-modules-core` in `backup-cloud` and `secure-storage-react-native` is `^58.0.0` (Expo SDK 58, the version the native modules are tested on) instead of `*`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 21e92a6: Every refusal after LI.FI answers now names the check that failed. Matrix v7 found 4 silent nulls.
  
  A bridge that takes its fee from the input (glacis: `estimate.fromAmount` about 0.25 % under the spent amount) is now quoted instead of refused:
  
  - **Limits:** the transaction must spend exactly the input, and the input-side fee may be at most 3 %.
  - **Amounts:** `sourceAmount` is the spent input, and `destAmount` already reflects the fee.
- e4083a3: npm metadata for the first public release: repository (with the package directory), homepage, bugs and publishConfig { access: public, provenance: true }; LICENSE inside every package; READMEs for core, conformance, protocol-swap2-core, swap2-assets and tx-preview-evm; descriptions for protocol-swap2-core and swap2-assets.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 40df5d2: `chooseRoute` hook: a cross-chain quote first reads `/advanced/routes`, hands the single-transaction candidates to the app and restricts `/quote` to its choice (allowBridges / denyBridges / order). Any failure, or a chosen bridge that disappears before `/quote`, falls back to LI.FI's default pick.
