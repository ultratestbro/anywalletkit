# @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-jupiter

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a78e14: New provider `@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-jupiter`: same-chain Solana swaps through Jupiter's Swap API V2 Router path (`GET /swap/v2/build`, Metis routing, no Jupiter swap fee; keyless at 0.5 RPS or an `apiKey` sent as `x-api-key`). Nothing from the API is used unchecked: only Jupiter v6 and token / system / ATA / compute-budget instructions, the taker as the only signer, no tip, and the swap instruction's own arguments (`route_v2` / `shared_accounts_route_v2`) decoded — input amount, quoted output, slippage and a zero platform fee must equal the request. The v0 transaction is assembled locally with the response's lookup tables; the compute budget is ours (limit = 1.2× a simulation when `rpcUrls` is given, price capped by `maxComputeUnitPrice`). The account executes it through its serialized-transaction guard and its own RPC.
  
  `wallet-solana`: the serialized-transaction guard counts the wallet's own wrapped-SOL token accounts as its SOL. Aggregator routes close the wallet's wSOL account, which also unwraps wSOL the wallet already held; that used to be refused as a token drain (live 2026-10-23: every large mainnet wallet probed held some wSOL), and a SOL output could not tell the wallet's own unwrapped wSOL from swap proceeds — now both are exact.
  
  `conformance`: `createMockAccount({serialized: true})` exposes swap2's `sendSerializedTransaction` hook; the swap2 behaviour suite checks serialized legs (the fixture's `serialized` decoder must accept what would be signed, and the account must execute exactly the reviewed bytes with the engine's balance expectation).

### Patch Changes

- 21e92a6: A swap the wallet cannot fund is refused in plain words: "not enough of the input token in the wallet (no token account for it)". The raw simulation error is kept after the wording.
  
  It covers Jupiter custom errors 6024 and 6025 and System Program error 1.
  
  6025 is not in Jupiter's published error table. It was confirmed on 2026-10-24: the same USDS / LINK / WBTC → USDC swaps fail with 6025 from an empty wallet and build fine from real holders.
