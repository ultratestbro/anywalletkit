# @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-router

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e27fc6: A remote stub's EVM calldata on a pinned contract needs the app's own check of the call (scan 2026-10-30, F3). A pinned contract executes whatever its arguments say — a CCTP burn's `mintRecipient`, an OFT send's `to`, a Diamond call's receiver — so the pin alone did not bind the call to the request. `remoteProvider` now marks a stub given `verifyQuote` with `verifiesQuotes` (as `verifyBuild` sets `verifiesBuilds`), the router keeps the marker in its snapshot, `remotePinRefusal` drops a remote EVM calldata quote from a stub with neither, and the engine refuses such a build before any approval.
  
  **Breaking:** a remote stub with hand-made `callTargets` and no `verifyQuote` / `verifyBuild` gets no EVM calldata route. Every shipped EVM pins export carries a check (`lifiPins`, `cctpPins`, `usdt0Pins`, `wrapPins`, `uniswapPins`, `balancerPins`, `fyndPins`, `chainflipPins`, `thorchainPins()`); Omniston keeps its app-supplied `verifyBuild: omnistonVerifyBuild(...)`, which satisfies the rule.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 88a4582: A remote stub's deposit-address and plain-value routes need the app's opt-in (scan 2026-10-28, F9). The pins applied only to builds with calldata, so a pinned calldata stub (LI.FI, CCTP, Uniswap, Balancer, wrap, USDT0, Chainflip) could answer with `depositAddress` = the backend's address, or a plain value send, and the engine paid it.
  
  - **Core / router:** `remoteProvider({depositAddressRoutes: true})` (also a `RemotePins` field) opens a stub to routes that pay an address its backend names. Without it, the engine refuses such a build and `remotePinRefusal` drops such a quote in the router and the single-provider path, on every chain. The router keeps the flag in its snapshot.
  - **NEAR Intents:** new `nearIntentsPins` — no call targets, no spenders, `depositAddressRoutes: true` (1Click deposit addresses are minted per quote).
  - **THORChain:** `thorchainPins()` set `depositAddressRoutes`: the Tron vault is the one `verifyBuild` confirms with two THORNodes.
  - **Chainflip:** `chainflipPins` set `depositAddressRoutes` and carry `verifyQuote: chainflipVerifyQuote`, the provider's own decode on the device: an EVM vault call on the pinned Vault, or a Tron send to the pinned Tron Vault whose note names the app's destination, refund address and a minimum price that guarantees the quoted minimum, with no DCA, boost, broker fee or affiliates; and `verifyBuild` requires the Tron note to go as hex bytes.
  
  **Breaking:** a remote stub without `depositAddressRoutes` gets no deposit-address or plain-value route — spread `...nearIntentsPins` into your NEAR Intents stub (THORChain's and Chainflip's pins already carry it); a remote Chainflip quote that fails `chainflipVerifyQuote` is refused. Upgrade notes: https://docs.anywallet.tech/getting-started/upgrading/.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 418fea1: A remote provider's addresses come from the app, never from its backend. `remoteProvider` takes `callTargets(chain)` / `spenders(chain)` — the provider package's pins, spread in: `lifiPins`, `fyndPins`, `uniswapPins`, `chainflipPins`, `cctpPins` (with its `claimTargets`), `usdt0Pins`, `balancerPins`, `wrapPins` — and an optional `verifyQuote(params, quote)` that runs the provider's own check on the client (`fyndPins` carries `fyndVerifyQuote`: `checkFyndTransaction` against the app's request). The stub is marked `remote: true`; the engine then lets its EVM routes call only pinned targets and approve only pinned spenders. **Fail closed: a remote stub without pins gets no EVM calldata route or approval** — the router and the single-provider path drop such a quote with the reason (`remotePinRefusal`), deposit-address routes need no pins. Wire the pins in every app that proxies providers through `createSwap2Handler`.
  
  For every provider, a token call in a swap's calldata must move the source token, at most the swap amount, to this account, the deposit address of a deposit-address route, or the declared spender (for a remote stub: the pins); `setApprovalForAll` and Permit2 `approve` are never a swap's main call, and `transferFrom` is refused. Before, `{to: USDC, data: approve(attacker, MAX), approvalAddress: attacker}` from a backend, or `cbBTC.transfer(attacker, all)` with `depositAddress = attacker`, passed because the allowlist was the response's own addresses. The router's provider snapshot now keeps the remote marker and the pins (dropped there, execution through the router took a remote stub for a local provider).
  
  **Breaking:** a `remoteProvider` without `callTargets` / `spenders` gets no calldata route on EVM — spread the provider's pins (`lifiPins`, `fyndPins`, …); swap calldata may only move the source token, by at most the input; an operator or Permit2 approval or a `transferFrom` as the swap call is refused. Upgrade notes: https://docs.anywallet.tech/getting-started/upgrading/.
- a4ceb50: A TON cell-body deposit (`bodyBoc`) is bound to the swap on the client instead of being sent as the build said. The message may attach the input plus at most `tonGasCeiling` nanoTON of gas (new engine option, default 1 TON; live Omniston swaps attach 0.1–0.7) — a jetton source the ceiling alone. A jetton source's body must be a TEP-74 transfer of exactly the input, from this account's own jetton wallet (the account's `getJettonWalletAddress`; an account without it cannot execute such a swap), with the excess returning to this account. The decoded body reaches `reviewExecution` (`cellBodyDecoded`, next to `cellBody: true`). **A remote stub's cell body is refused unless the app gave it `verifyBuild`**, and a remote native-source body must go to a pinned `callTargets` address when the app pins any. Before, `{to: attacker, value: <whole balance>, bodyBoc}` or a transfer of the whole jetton balance to the attacker from the user's own jetton wallet went to the account untouched. `verifyBuild` now also receives the request the quote answered, and may be async; the router keeps a stub's `verifiesBuilds` flag. `tonRawAddress` (friendly/raw TON address comparison without @ton/core) is exported.
  
  Omniston: `omnistonVerifyBuild({validateTonSwapTarget, validateTonSwapLeg, integratorAddress})` is the app's check of a remote TON swap build — `checkTonSwapPayload` against the app's own request plus the app's DEX validators; swap quotes carry `providerData.routeSteps` for it. A TON → EVM escrow body cannot be checked on the client and is refused by the helper.
  
  **Breaking:** a jetton-source TON swap needs a signer with `getJettonWalletAddress`; a TON transaction carrying more than the input plus `tonGasCeiling` (1 TON) is refused; a remote cell body needs `verifyBuild`. Upgrade notes: https://docs.anywallet.tech/getting-started/upgrading/.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- b1350b4: Every type a public signature uses is exported, so the API reference documents it and apps can name it: the provider config types (`LifiSwap2Config`, `BalancerSwap2Config`, `NearIntentsSwap2Config`, `FyndSwap2Config`, …), the explorer client options in history-evm (`EtherscanClientOptions`, `AlchemyClientOptions`, `BlockscoutClientOptions`), `Swap2ExecutionPhase`, the Omniston client shapes, and the row / view types the chain packages already expose through their methods. Type-only additions, plus the account-meta role constants of native SOL staking (`READONLY`, `WRITABLE`, …). Renames on export: Aave and Morpho activity `Action` → `AaveActivityAction` / `MorphoActivityAction`; conformance `ProtocolCtor` / `WriteProtocolCtor`; history-evm `RawRow`.
- eb14cb5: npm metadata: every package has a description and the `anywalletkit` keyword. The LI.FI, NEAR Intents, Omniston and THORChain packages had an empty description, so npm showed the README badge markdown in its place, and 24 packages were missing from a `keywords:anywalletkit` search. `pnpm pack:check` now refuses a package without either.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- 398129f: Node 20 is no longer supported: `engines.node` is now `>=22`. Node 20 reached end of life in April 2026 and gets no security fixes, including the October 2026 release (Brotli decoder, `dns.resolve`, TLS hostname checks; fixed in 22.23.4, 24.22.1 and 26.12.1). CI tests on Node 22 and 24 and refuses to run on an unpatched Node.
- b55aa5d: `claimSwap2` now calls only a contract the provider declares for the destination chain (new `CrossChainProvider.claimTargets(chain)`; CCTP: its MessageTransmitter), and refuses claim calldata that moves the account's tokens or grants an allowance. A provider with a claim step must declare its targets; a remote provider stub takes them from the app (`remoteProvider({ claimTargets })`, e.g. `cctpClaimTargets` from `@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-cctp`), never from the server. The router passes them through.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 0d0e46e: Swaps of tokens the catalog does not list (a user's own tokens, named by EVM contract or Solana mint), opt-in with `allowUnlistedTokens: true` on the engine and on `createSwap2Handler`; off by default, nothing changes without it. The engine reads the source token's decimals with the account's `getTokenInfo` (cached; a disagreeing `fromTokenDecimals` is refused) and sends them as `QuoteParams.sourceDecimals`; approvals go to the named token for the exact amount and the quoted spender, with the same value binding as catalog tokens. LI.FI, Uniswap, Balancer and Fynd resolve the source with the new `sourceAssetOf(params)`; providers with their own asset lists keep refusing. `swap2-assets` adds `isTokenAddress`, `unlistedAsset`, `isUnlisted`, `resolveAsset` (catalog first, always) and `catalogChainId`.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 07db4c1: Audit 2026-10-25, findings 16 and 17.
  
  - **Number() on bigints.** A real ESLint now runs on every package (`pnpm lint`, in CI): typescript-eslint's `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises`, and a local `no-number-bigint` rule (`Number(x)` of a bigint is lossy above 2^53 and garbage on Hermes above 2^63). Its 92 findings are fixed: values that come from outside are range-checked as bigints before they become numbers (a typed-data or transaction `chainId`, token `decimals` in tx-preview, ABI string lengths, protobuf field numbers in Tron, an RPC nonce in extension-kit, the Permit2 lockdown count in kit's policies, Mellow's asset count); sort comparators compare bigints exactly; panic codes print the bigint; display values go through `bigintToNumber`. A `chainId` that is not a safe integer is now refused by wallet-evm before signing (`UnsafeTransactionError`), and `describeTransaction` reports it as a chain mismatch.
  - **engines.** Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
  - **Peers.** `expo-modules-core` in `backup-cloud` and `secure-storage-react-native` is `^58.0.0` (Expo SDK 58, the version the native modules are tested on) instead of `*`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7f5d0fe: Value information on quotes (owner decision 2026-10-16: inform, never block). `quoteValues(prices, params, quotes)` in swap2-router gives every quote its USD in / out, loss %, the venue's price impact and the better alternative inside the set; the Uniswap provider measures its pool's price impact with a 1/1000 probe on the chosen route and reports it as `providerData.priceImpactBps`. The Oct 16 funded run lost ~$33 on two Uniswap legs that nothing compared against the other venues.

### Patch Changes

- bd4ea91: `bigintToNumber` / `bigintToUnits` in core: BigInt → Number that stays correct on engines whose multi-limb conversion is broken (Hermes on Linux x64 returns 3·2^64 for `Number(2n ** 64n)`). Aave rates and health factors, Morpho utilization / health / LTV / fees and the router's quote USD values now convert through it.
