The swap2 engine: one interface for swaps and bridges ("swap2"), and the execution safety every swap2 provider package relies on.

## Install

```sh
npm install @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-core @anywalletkit/core
# or: pnpm add @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-core @anywalletkit/core  ·  yarn add @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-core @anywalletkit/core
```

On npm: [@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-core), published from the [release workflow](https://github.com/ultratestbro/anywalletkit/blob/main/RELEASING.md) with provenance.

- **`BaseSwap2Protocol` / `SingleProviderSwap2`** — a `Swap2Protocol` (from `@anywalletkit/core`) over a provider. It quotes, binds the execution to the quote, runs approvals, sends, and resumes status by id (`getSwap2Status`, `claimSwap2` for two-phase routes).
- **Safety checks.** Quote validation, a minimum-output floor, fee caps, a review gate before signing, and refusals that name their reason. Status ids look like `awk1.<provider>.<intent>[.<hash>]` (`SWAP2_ID_PREFIX`).
- **`remoteProvider`** — runs a provider on your server (API keys, shared state) while the app keeps the keys and signs.
- **`createSwap2Handler`** (`@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-core/server`, server-only) — the other end of `remoteProvider`: validates every request, HMAC-seals only quotes that pass the engine's own checks (`validQuote`: provider, input, floor, slippage, expiry; else 502) and builds only sealed, unexpired ones, puts an intent token on every swap id (tracking, claims and notices without it are refused), passes refusals through with URLs redacted; you supply `guard` (auth + rate limits, it sees the validated request) and, with per-user sign-in, `subject` (quotes and swap ids bound to the user). A reference server: [`examples/server`](https://github.com/ultratestbro/anywalletkit/tree/main/examples/server).
- **Errors** — `Swap2Error` and its subclasses (quote, validation, execution, fee limit, status…).
- **Activity helpers** — what `describeActivity` implementations share.

Providers live in their own packages: `@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-near-intents`, `-lifi`, `-thorchain`, `-omniston`, `-cctp`, `-usdt0`, `-chainflip`, `-jupiter`, `-uniswap`, `-balancer`, `-wrap`. `@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-router` auctions several of them.
