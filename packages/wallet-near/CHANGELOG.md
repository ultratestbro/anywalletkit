# @forgewallet/wallet-near

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 82464d8: `WalletManager` keeps the 64-byte seed, never the mnemonic string: a phrase passed to a constructor is stretched there and dropped (strings cannot be zeroized, `Uint8Array`s can). Chain managers read it through `seedBytes()`; the base `dispose()` zeroizes it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`forgewallet` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).
