# @anywalletkit/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b6d97f: No secret is an object property anywhere. `Wallet` no longer keeps the seed phrase string: it turns the phrase into the 64-byte seed in the constructor, hands each chain manager a copy, and `dispose()` zeroizes it and refuses later calls; `new Wallet(seedBytes)` and managers built from seed bytes are accepted (copied). `LocalSigner` keys and seeds and `WalletManager` seeds live in module WeakMaps, so `console.log`, `JSON.stringify`, `util.inspect` and crash reporters see only public fields; `LocalSigner.toJSON()` is the public view. Accounts get leaf signers (`LocalSigner.leafFromSeed`, `deriveLeaf`) that hold only their own key, never a copy of the master seed. Before: `JSON.stringify(account)` contained the private key and the master seed, and `console.log(wallet)` printed the phrase. The conformance chain suite now walks every property reachable from a manager and an account and fails if a key, the seed or the phrase is found. Manager constructors take `string | Uint8Array | Signer`.

### Patch Changes

- e4083a3: npm metadata for the first public release: repository (with the package directory), homepage, bugs and publishConfig { access: public, provenance: true }; LICENSE inside every package; READMEs for core, conformance, protocol-swap2-core, swap2-assets and tx-preview-evm; descriptions for protocol-swap2-core and swap2-assets.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bd4ea91: `bigintToNumber` / `bigintToUnits` in core: BigInt → Number that stays correct on engines whose multi-limb conversion is broken (Hermes on Linux x64 returns 3·2^64 for `Number(2n ** 64n)`). Aave rates and health factors, Morpho utilization / health / LTV / fees and the router's quote USD values now convert through it.
- 386615c: `NameResolver` interface (`resolve(name, chain)`, forward-verified `reverse`, `avatar`, `supports`), `NameError` codes, `ResolvedName` with warnings, `nameResolvers([...])` to stack resolvers, `assertNameUnchanged` for the signing-time check, `isNameLike`. Conformance gains `namesSuite`.

### Patch Changes

- 82464d8: `WalletManager` keeps the 64-byte seed, never the mnemonic string: a phrase passed to a constructor is stretched there and dropped (strings cannot be zeroized, `Uint8Array`s can). Chain managers read it through `seedBytes()`; the base `dispose()` zeroizes it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`anywalletkit` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).
