# @anywalletkit/core

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 8aa911d: Audit 2026-10-25 (post-release), low findings L3–L7:
  
  - **backup-cloud (L3).** `iCloudKeychain().getOrCreate` runs one call at a time per keychain item, process-wide. Two at once (a double tap on "back up") both saw no key, both created one, and the second overwrote the key the first backup had just been sealed with, so that file no longer opened without its password. Each caller still gets its own copy of the key.
  - **keyring (L4).** `importMnemonic(phrase, { adoptId })` reads the id once and requires it to hold this phrase and passphrase (`{"type":"mnemonic",…}`). Before, the source took the id unread: the accounts' addresses came from the phrase passed in, while signatures used whatever the id held. A missing, different or unreadable secret is refused with `invalid-input`; a bad or taken id and a phrase already in the keyring are refused before that read (no prompt).
  - **extension-kit (L5).** `Vault.addPasskey` is refused (`invalid-input`) while the vault holds no secret. With nothing to prove the DEK against, any 32 bytes were sealed under the passkey, and every later passkey unlock handed out that wrong key.
  - **core (L6).** `assertNameUnchanged` compares addresses without case only on `eip155:*`. On other chains a case variant of a base58 address is another key, and it passed as "unchanged".
  - **networks (L7).** `rpcUrlsForSync` / `usesUserRpcSync` throw `NetworkError('not-loaded')` before `load()`. They answered from the builtin table, so a client built at cold start used public RPCs the user had turned off (`onlyOwnRpc`), and the review sheet called the RPC not custom. `listSync` / `getSync` still answer builtin-only before `load()`. A failed storage read no longer counts as an empty table: `load()` rejects and stays retryable, and no write runs on top of it (the next write used to replace the user's stored RPCs).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 80d6451: No signing account outlives `WalletManager.dispose()`. Every chain manager awaited between its cache check and storing the account, so: an account whose build was in flight during `dispose()` was created afterwards with a live key (a child derived from an injected seed signer kept signing); concurrent `getAccount` calls for one path built two accounts and leaked the first; a signer-built manager handed out new accounts after `dispose()`. New protected `cachedAccount()` / `signerAccount()` in core build each account once, refuse after dispose, dispose an account finished late and a derived child that never became an account. All seven chain managers use them. `describeChainModule` checks the contract (one account under concurrent calls, none after dispose). Audit 2026-10-25, #3.
- 80d6451: `policies.maxFee` now holds for the transaction that is signed, not only for the quote. The kit compared the cap with `quoteSendTransaction` (an EVM estimate of 21 000 gas) while the account signed its own gas limit with headroom (25 200 gas), so a 22 000 000 wei cap let a 25 200 000 wei transaction through. New `WriteOptions { maxFee }` in core is an optional second argument of `sendTransaction`, `signTransaction` and `transfer`; every chain package checks the tighter of it and its configured `transactionMaxFee` / `transferMaxFee` on what it signs (`feeLimit()` helper), and the kit passes the tightest matching policy cap through it after the quote check. A write whose quote fits but whose signed worst case does not is now refused by the account after `confirm`, with the chain package's own error (EVM: `Error('Exceeded maximum fee cost…')`), not `PolicyViolationError`. Audit 2026-10-25, #4.

### Patch Changes

- 07db4c1: Audit 2026-10-25, findings 16 and 17.
  
  - **Number() on bigints.** A real ESLint now runs on every package (`pnpm lint`, in CI): typescript-eslint's `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises`, and a local `no-number-bigint` rule (`Number(x)` of a bigint is lossy above 2^53 and garbage on Hermes above 2^63). Its 92 findings are fixed: values that come from outside are range-checked as bigints before they become numbers (a typed-data or transaction `chainId`, token `decimals` in tx-preview, ABI string lengths, protobuf field numbers in Tron, an RPC nonce in extension-kit, the Permit2 lockdown count in kit's policies, Mellow's asset count); sort comparators compare bigints exactly; panic codes print the bigint; display values go through `bigintToNumber`. A `chainId` that is not a safe integer is now refused by wallet-evm before signing (`UnsafeTransactionError`), and `describeTransaction` reports it as a chain mismatch.
  - **engines.** Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
  - **Peers.** `expo-modules-core` in `backup-cloud` and `secure-storage-react-native` is `^58.0.0` (Expo SDK 58, the version the native modules are tested on) instead of `*`.
- 80d6451: Seed bytes passed as a Node `Buffer` (or any view into a larger buffer) are now copied, not aliased. `Wallet`, `WalletManager` and `LocalSigner.fromSeed` took the copy with `.slice()`, which on a `Buffer` is a view sharing the caller's memory: zeroizing the input after construction changed every key derived later, and `dispose()` wiped the caller's bytes. New `copyBytes()` in core makes the independent copy; `sealBackup` copies byte secrets the same way and zeroizes its copy.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 2975c93: README: an npm badge and an Install section (npm / pnpm / yarn, the peers to add, a link to the package on npm and to the release workflow that publishes it with provenance).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 65c3bca: First release through npm trusted publishing: published from the release workflow over GitHub OIDC, with no npm token anywhere. No code change in this package beyond what its other changesets list.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b6d97f: No secret is an object property anywhere. `Wallet` no longer keeps the seed phrase string: it turns the phrase into the 64-byte seed in the constructor, hands each chain manager a copy, and `dispose()` zeroizes it and refuses later calls; `new Wallet(seedBytes)` and managers built from seed bytes are accepted (copied). `LocalSigner` keys and seeds and `WalletManager` seeds live in module WeakMaps, so `console.log`, `JSON.stringify`, `util.inspect` and crash reporters see only public fields; `LocalSigner.toJSON()` is the public view. Accounts get leaf signers (`LocalSigner.leafFromSeed`, `deriveLeaf`) that hold only their own key, never a copy of the master seed. Before: `JSON.stringify(account)` contained the private key and the master seed, and `console.log(wallet)` printed the phrase. The conformance chain suite now walks every property reachable from a manager and an account and fails if a key, the seed or the phrase is found. Manager constructors take `string | Uint8Array | Signer`.

### Patch Changes

- e4083a3: npm metadata for the first public release: repository (with the package directory), homepage, bugs and publishConfig { access: public, provenance: true }; LICENSE inside every package; READMEs for core, conformance, protocol-swap2-core, swap2-assets and tx-preview-evm; descriptions for protocol-swap2-core and swap2-assets.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bd4ea91: `bigintToNumber` / `bigintToUnits` in core: BigInt → Number that stays correct on engines whose multi-limb conversion is broken (Hermes on Linux x64 returns 3·2^64 for `Number(2n ** 64n)`). Aave rates and health factors, Morpho utilization / health / LTV / fees and the router's quote USD values now convert through it.
- 386615c: `NameResolver` interface (`resolve(name, chain)`, forward-verified `reverse`, `avatar`, `supports`), `NameError` codes, `ResolvedName` with warnings, `nameResolvers([...])` to stack resolvers, `assertNameUnchanged` for the signing-time check, `isNameLike`. Conformance gains `namesSuite`.

### Patch Changes

- 82464d8: `WalletManager` keeps the 64-byte seed, never the mnemonic string: a phrase passed to a constructor is stretched there and dropped (strings cannot be zeroized, `Uint8Array`s can). Chain managers read it through `seedBytes()`; the base `dispose()` zeroizes it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`anywalletkit` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).
