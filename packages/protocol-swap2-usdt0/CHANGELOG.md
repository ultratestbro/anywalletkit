# @anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-usdt0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7004ecf: New package: USDT0 — Tether's LayerZero OFT for USDT — as a swap2 provider. USDT / USDT0 between 13 EVM chains (Ethereum adapter, Arbitrum, OP, Polygon, HyperEVM, Ink, Berachain, Unichain, Sei, Plasma, Monad, MegaETH, X Layer) in one source transaction: `quoteOFT` + `quoteSend` on the OFT itself, `send` with the LayerZero fee as `msg.value` (declared as `nativeFee`), approval only for the Ethereum adapter, every deployment bound on-chain (`token()`, `approvalRequired()`, `peers`), preflight against the live fee, status from LayerZero Scan (DELIVERED carries the destination hash), and the `lzReceive` retry of a stored payload as the engine's claim. The asset catalog gains USDT0 on HyperEVM and Unichain.
- 2d6c0f1: USDT0 on Mantle (eid 30181), Morph (30322) and Flare (30295) — 16 deployments, every one re-read on-chain (token, approvalRequired, sharedDecimals, endpoint, Arbitrum peer).

### Patch Changes

- 3ea8e2d: Activity: an OFT `send` folds the LayerZero messaging fee (the native value) into `fee` instead of listing it as an asset the owner swapped away, and names both ends when the calldata carries the destination ("Bridged USDT → USDT0", subtitle "USDT0 · Ethereum → HyperEVM").
- 5c02895: The sealed LayerZero fee carries 25 % headroom over the quote: the fee is paid at send time and moves with gas, so a quote a minute old failed preflight ("fee rose … re-quote"); the endpoint refunds the unused part to the trader in the same transaction. Preflight refuses only a fee past the headroom.
