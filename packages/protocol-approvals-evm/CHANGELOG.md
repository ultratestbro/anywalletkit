# @anywalletkit/protocol-approvals-evm

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 2975c93: README: an npm badge and an Install section (npm / pnpm / yarn, the peers to add, a link to the package on npm and to the release workflow that publishes it with provenance).
- Updated dependencies [2975c93]
  - @anywalletkit/core@0.3.2

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 6c4f606: The account types these modules take no longer declare a public `_config`. A `wallet-evm` account keeps its RPC in a protected `_config`, so `new LidoProtocolEvm(account)` (and SSV, Mellow, Approvals) with a real `WalletAccountEvm` or `WalletAccountReadOnlyEvm` failed to type-check — only the loosely typed `wallet.registerProtocol` path compiled. The modules still pick up the account's RPC when `config.provider` is absent.
- 65c3bca: First release through npm trusted publishing: published from the release workflow over GitHub OIDC, with no npm token anywhere. No code change in this package beyond what its other changesets list.
- Updated dependencies [65c3bca]
  - @anywalletkit/core@0.3.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d7976e: Security audit 2026-10-13 fixes that had stayed on a side branch: Solana provider-tx guard refuses System Assign/Allocate, Token Batch and undecodable core instructions and checks ownership/authority in the post-state (F1, F2); tx-preview flags native value to unlabeled contracts and unverified token symbols (F5); approvals gets a strict `isRevokeCalldata` and a new `isRevokeTransaction` (F8); kit `applyPolicies` resolves or refuses an unknown EVM chain (F4); NEAR caps token storage deposits (F12); TON checks the jetton wallet's owner and master (F13); EVM signing detects the chain before the mismatch check and strips EIP-712 array types linearly (F16, F17); near-intents strips control characters from logs (F18).
- 6568e08: Renames: the base of every swap2 error is now `Swap2Error`; the pinned derivation vectors are exported as `derivationVectors` and shipped as `vectors/derivation.json` (values unchanged). The approvals module drops its policy-engine rule set and its `Policy` / `PolicyRule` / `PolicyContext` types — the kit's policies treat revokes as `kind: 'revoke'` on their own; `isRevokeCalldata` and `isUnlimitedAmount` stay. THORChain's default `clientId` is `anywalletkit`.

### Patch Changes

- e4083a3: npm metadata for the first public release: repository (with the package directory), homepage, bugs and publishConfig { access: public, provenance: true }; LICENSE inside every package; READMEs for core, conformance, protocol-swap2-core, swap2-assets and tx-preview-evm; descriptions for protocol-swap2-core and swap2-assets.
- Updated dependencies [4b6d97f]
- Updated dependencies [e4083a3]
  - @anywalletkit/core@0.3.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e61b1a: Ported from plain ESM on ethers v6 to TypeScript on viem, built with tsup (ESM + CJS + d.ts). Same exports, same calldata and typed data, same error messages; the `provider` option still takes an RPC url or an EIP-1193 object. Receipt waits now time out after 180 s (viem default) instead of waiting forever; the `./package` subpath export is gone (`./package.json` stays).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [82464d8]
  - @anywalletkit/core@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`anywalletkit` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @anywalletkit/core@0.1.0
