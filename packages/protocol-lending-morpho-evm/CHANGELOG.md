## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 0e43992: Follow-ups from a review of the modules-scan fixes against the code (2026-10-28).
  - **CCIP-Read is off** in every viem client the SDK creates: wallet-evm, approvals and the protocol modules. names-ens keeps its own filtered one. A contract's `OffchainLookup` revert no longer makes the device fetch URLs it names, LAN addresses included. Two cases were reachable: an approvals scan calls every contract that emitted an Approval naming the user, spam tokens included, and wallet-evm reads tokens the user added.
  - **networks:** `isPrivateHost` treats a host that is not printable ASCII as private. A URL parser maps `127.0.0.１`, `127。0。0。1` and `ｒｏｕｔｅｒ.ｌａｎ` to 127.0.0.1 and router.lan (IDNA), so these got past `isPublicHttpsUrl`. Names in other scripts arrive as punycode and stay public. 6to4 addresses (`2002::/16`) carry their IPv4.
  - **tokens:**
    - The look-alike danger rule now also covers more lettering: Roman numerals, small capitals from Latin Extended-D/E, enclosed letters of the supplement (🅤), Tifinagh, Vai, Deseret, Osage, Lycian, Carian, Old Italic, Warang Citi and Georgian's look-alike letters.
    - It now covers more characters that hide: C0 and C1 controls, line breaks inside a symbol, the braille blank, interlinear annotation, tag characters (ASCII smuggling) and astral format controls.
    - It reads the stored symbol as well as the raw head, so leading spaces cannot push a look-alike out.
    - Fewer false alarms: ™ ℠ ℗, the tag-sequence flag emoji and ZWNJ in Persian or Indic spelling stay a caution.
    - `foldSymbol` drops spaces after NFKD, so "USDC´" reads as USDC.
  - **names-ens:** `ipfsGateway` may be an origin (`/ipfs/<cid>` is appended, as before the fix) or a prefix ending in `/ipfs/`.
  - **approvals:** `isRevokeTransaction` never throws, and `targets` may also be a plain object or `[address, standard]` pairs.
  - **mellow:** `claimWithdrawals` claims only on pinned redeem queues, like every other queue call.
  - **swap2-core:** `remoteProvider` trims `baseUrl` and refuses a scheme-relative one (`//host`). A leading space or `//` used to get past the https check.
  - **omniston:** `createOmnistonTonValidators()` declares the validators it always returns as required, so `omnistonVerifyBuild({ ...createOmnistonTonValidators() })` typechecks.

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- b1350b4: Every type a public signature uses is exported, so the API reference documents it and apps can name it: the provider config types (`LifiSwap2Config`, `BalancerSwap2Config`, `NearIntentsSwap2Config`, `FyndSwap2Config`, …), the explorer client options in history-evm (`EtherscanClientOptions`, `AlchemyClientOptions`, `BlockscoutClientOptions`), `Swap2ExecutionPhase`, the Omniston client shapes, and the row / view types the chain packages already expose through their methods. Type-only additions, plus the account-meta role constants of native SOL staking (`READONLY`, `WRITABLE`, …). Renames on export: Aave and Morpho activity `Action` → `AaveActivityAction` / `MorphoActivityAction`; conformance `ProtocolCtor` / `WriteProtocolCtor`; history-evm `RawRow`.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- 9e4bcd2: Morpho Vault V2 supply and withdraw work. V2 answers 0 from `maxDeposit` / `maxMint` / `maxWithdraw` / `maxRedeem` for every address (verified on Base on the Steakhouse High Yield USDC V2 vault), so every V2 deposit was refused as "deposits are closed" and every V2 withdrawal as "only 0 withdrawable". For V2 the module now reads the transfer gates (`canReceiveShares` + `canSendAssets` on the way in, `canSendShares` + `canReceiveAssets` on the way out; a closed one is refused with `CannotReceiveShares` / `CannotSendAssets`) and leaves caps and liquidity to the `eth_call` proof it already runs before sending. `getPosition().withdrawable` on V2 is the whole position when redeeming it simulates cleanly, else the vault's idle assets. V1 is unchanged.
- 398129f: Node 20 is no longer supported: `engines.node` is now `>=22`. Node 20 reached end of life in April 2026 and gets no security fixes, including the October 2026 release (Brotli decoder, `dns.resolve`, TLS hostname checks; fixed in 22.23.4, 24.22.1 and 26.12.1). CI tests on Node 22 and 24 and refuses to run on an unpatched Node.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 07db4c1: Audit 2026-10-25, findings 16 and 17.
  
  - **Number() on bigints.** A real ESLint now runs on every package (`pnpm lint`, in CI): typescript-eslint's `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises`, and a local `no-number-bigint` rule (`Number(x)` of a bigint is lossy above 2^53 and garbage on Hermes above 2^63). Its 92 findings are fixed: values that come from outside are range-checked as bigints before they become numbers (a typed-data or transaction `chainId`, token `decimals` in tx-preview, ABI string lengths, protobuf field numbers in Tron, an RPC nonce in extension-kit, the Permit2 lockdown count in kit's policies, Mellow's asset count); sort comparators compare bigints exactly; panic codes print the bigint; display values go through `bigintToNumber`. A `chainId` that is not a safe integer is now refused by wallet-evm before signing (`UnsafeTransactionError`), and `describeTransaction` reports it as a chain mismatch.
  - **engines.** Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
  - **Peers.** `expo-modules-core` in `backup-cloud` and `secure-storage-react-native` is `^58.0.0` (Expo SDK 58, the version the native modules are tested on) instead of `*`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- bd4ea91: `bigintToNumber` / `bigintToUnits` in core: BigInt → Number that stays correct on engines whose multi-limb conversion is broken (Hermes on Linux x64 returns 3·2^64 for `Number(2n ** 64n)`). Aave rates and health factors, Morpho utilization / health / LTV / fees and the router's quote USD values now convert through it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- First versioned release of the SDK: every package leaves 0.0.1 / the ported 0.1.x. From here on versions move only through changesets, and every vendored build carries the commit it was built from (`anywalletkit` field in package.json, `manifest.json` next to the tarballs).
