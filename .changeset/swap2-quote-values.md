Value information on quotes (owner decision 2026-10-16: inform, never block). `quoteValues(prices, params, quotes)` in swap2-router gives every quote its USD in / out, loss %, the venue's price impact and the better alternative inside the set; the Uniswap provider measures its pool's price impact with a 1/1000 probe on the chosen route and reports it as `providerData.priceImpactBps`. The Oct 16 funded run lost ~$33 on two Uniswap legs that nothing compared against the other venues.
