TON deposits with a memo: `transfer({memo})` on a TON account sends it as the jetton forward-payload comment (TEP-74) or the native message comment (memo + forwardPayload together is refused), and swap2-core now executes TON jetton deposits that carry a memo through that surface, like Tron and NEAR token deposits — before, they were refused as not implemented.
