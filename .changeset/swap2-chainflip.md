New provider `@anywalletkit/protocol-swap2-chainflip`: Chainflip vault swaps (native BTC / ETH / SOL / TRX, USDC / USDT) from Ethereum, Arbitrum and Tron into Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, Tron and Bitcoin through Chainflip's public backend (no broker account, 0 bps). The encoder's output is decoded and checked before anything is signed (vault, destination chain / asset / address, amount, refund = sender, min price ≥ ours, no DCA / boost / broker fee / affiliates); fill-or-kill refunds to the sender. Tron sources are a TRC-20 transfer to the Vault with the swap as a binary note, so `UnsignedTx.memoEncoding` (`"utf8"` default, `"hex"`) is new in swap2-core and `wallet-tron` accepts `memoEncoding` on transfers and contract calls (`memoBytes` exported).
